This project was developed as part of the CSE445 Machine Learning course at North South University. The aim is to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using various machine learning models and evaluate their effectiveness on real-world financial data.
Project Overview
The aim of this project is to develop an intelligent fraud detection system that can accurately identify suspicious credit card transactions. The solution leverages various machine learning models, enhanced with data balancing techniques like SMOTE to deal with highly imbalanced datasets.

This is accomplished by:

Preprocessing and analyzing transaction data

Training multiple ML models on labeled datasets

Applying SMOTE to improve detection of rare fraud cases

Comparing model performance using evaluation metrics

Visualizing confusion matrices and ROC curves
